You just need to run it from the repository right here or for better enjoyment clone the repository and run it on your desktop.
The repository already brings everything you need, such as the resources, all the code, every picture, and even Api where you can check every answer you need for the riddles so you can enjoy every finale of this game.
I encourage you to enjoy it slowly, to think everything you are going to answer very deeply and to write on the comment section of this game what are your thoughts about it! Everything you felt for it is more then ok !
Enjoy the experience!

ps: For now it's only available in spanish but soon i'll make it also in english and some other custom options so you can try as much as your like as possible!
